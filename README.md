# penpapercoffee-syntax theme

*penPaperCoffee* is a syntax theme for the editor [atom](http://atom.io/), which is designed specifically for writing papers, essays etc. in [markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown).
The theme features increased font-sizes for each level of headers, several useful, but not distracting syntax highlightings.
The overall colors are inspired by the soft beige paper you would find in a notebook. While the ink (text color) is a dark blue, all quotes and citations are in a warm brownish orange to contrast them better to your own words.

Although the theme was designed for markdown usage, I paid attention that it still looks good and clear if you open other documents (eg. javascript, C).
