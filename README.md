# penpapercoffee-syntax theme

A atom syntax theme specifically for writing papers, essays etc. in markdown.
The theme features increased font-sizes for each level of header. And several syntax highlightings.
The overall colors are inspired by a soft beige paper color you would find in a writing notebook. The ink (text color) is a dark blue.

All quotes and citations are in a warm orange to contrast them to your own writings.
