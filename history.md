- new revamped syntax colors for non-markup languages
  please tell me how you like them. I used to be unhappy with them,
  I personally think the colors for non-markup looks much better now.
  I might tweak them a bit, maybe reducing saturation. But they shouldn't change dramatically anymore.
- first tests for later pandoc-markdown-language package
- some tweaks here and there
- general cleanup
